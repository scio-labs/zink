This is a helper library for developing ink! smart contracts. It contains useful Rust macros that extend functionality and reduce boilerplate code.

The project is part of a [Scio Labs](https://scio.xyz) initiative to improve the developer experience in the ink! ecosystem. Other projects include:

- `create-ink-app` CLI (_Coming soon_)
- [`ink!athon`](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon) Boilerplate
- [`useInkathon`](https://github.com/scio-labs/use-inkathon) Hooks & Utility Library
- [`zink!`](https://github.com/scio-labs/zink) Smart Contract Macros

| `Ownable2Step` | This module provides a two-step ownership transfer mechanism. It includes methods for getting the current and pending admin, transferring ownership, and accepting ownership. The ownership transfer is not immediate but requires the new owner to accept the ownership. This adds an extra layer of security to the contract. | âœ…      |
| `Upgradable`   | This module provides a mechanism for upgrading the contract. It includes a method for setting a new code hash, effectively upgrading the contract to a new version. This is useful for contracts that may need to be updated or fixed after they have been deployed.                                                            | âœ…      |
